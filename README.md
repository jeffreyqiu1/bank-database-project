# bank-database-project
This is a bank teller desktop application I made for a school project. It allows bank tellers to keep a record of all clients and their account balances, like you'd find on the screens at any in-person bank. Tellers can create new client accounts and process transactions, and the database will be updated.

To run the app, click on the green "Code" button above the files, then click "Download Zip". The repository will be downloaded to your computer. Extract the repository, then click on the Bank.jar file in the Program Files folder and the program will start.

Viewing client account balances and making deposits. Freezing accounts prevents the balance from changing. The clients are organized in a linked list so it's easy to go from client to client with the previous and next buttons.
